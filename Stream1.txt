3.1 Operating on streams
------------------------
Map 
-----
map() method takes a Function and transforms the elements of stream into another.
Example, a map might map a stream of numbers to their stream of squares.

filter
------
filter() method takes a Predicate and tests each element in the stream pipeline,
and produce a stream of elements that pass the test.


reduce
--------
 It reduces the stream into a single value. Since it is a terminal operation, stream will be closed afterwards.
count() is an example of reduce operation.
